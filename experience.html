  <div class="card-body">
    <p class="card-text"> In my opinion, online classes are more practical and relaxed, because we only need to access them via handphones, laptops or other electronic devices and we are not required to get up early. No need to rush off or get ready for school, no need for pocket money to commute. When in your break time, you can use it for lying down, eating and other relaxing things. When online class than can brings us closer to family. If the clock is empty or there is no zoom, the time can be used for other things, such as learning new things or reading any book. </p>

    <p> Online classroom learning itself not only has its ups and downs. The things that are less enjoyable during online classes in my opinion are more mental training, get tired quickly, and easily get dizzy or have back pain if you keep staring at the screen. Sometimes the material is more difficult to accept, meaning that it is more difficult for me to understand the learning material. Often there are obstacles, namely connection problems, blackouts, signal difficulties and others. Also, because I don't need money to commute, I don't get pocket money to save. Save it to buy novels, or other books and for other purposes.</p>
